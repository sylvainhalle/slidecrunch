<h1>SlideCrunch Documentation</h1>

<p>SlideCrunch is a "Swiss Army knife" for anything related to the management
of slide-based presentations. It can be used to produce slideshows from
multiple input files. Moreover,
if you provide information regarding slide duration
or text, it can also generate annotated handouts, mixing scripts for producing
a timed video and even matching subtitles.</p>

<p>As an example, this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_G563H7DA">slidecast</a> was
generated automatically with SlideCrunch.</p>

<h2>Why use SliceCrunch?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Everything runs locally on your machine. You are not tied to an Internet connection, and the
videos you produce are not locked somewhere "in the cloud".</li>
<li>It uses a toolchain made of entirely free and cross-platform software.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Download SlideCrunch</h2>

<p>Get the latest release of SlideCrunch on the <a href="https://github.com/sylvainhalle/slidecrunch/releases">GitHub project page</a>.</p>

<a name="quickstart"></a><h2>Quick Start</h2> <!-- {{{ -->

<p>SlideCrunch can be invoked very easily and assumes many default values
for the input and output files. All these values can be overriden through
<a href="#options">command line options</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>To <strong>merge a sequence of slide files</strong> into a single
output PDF, type:</p>

<pre>
slidecrunch slideshow
</pre>

<p>SlideCrunch will look for the list of files to combine in
<tt>slideshow.txt</tt> and output them into <a href="#inputfile"><tt>slideshow.pdf</tt></a>.
If the list contains multi-layered SVG files, they are converted into
multi-page PDF according to the conventions of
<a href="http://projects.abourget.net/inkscapeslide/">InkscapeSlide</a>.
(This option requires pdftk +
inkscapeslide for SVG management, see the
<a href="#requirements">requirements</a>.)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To <strong>produce a handout</strong> from a set of slides, type:</p>

<pre>
slidecrunch handout
</pre>

<p>SlideCrunch will look for the slides in <tt>slideshow.pdf</tt>, place
them vertically at 4 per page, with the text associated to each slide
taken from <a href="#inputfile"><tt>slideshow.txt</tt></a>. 
The resulting document will be
<tt>handout.pdf</tt>. (This option requires LaTeX, see the
<a href="#requirements">requirements</a>.)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To <strong>produce a subtitle file</strong> from a set of slides, type:</p>

<pre>
slidecrunch subtitles
</pre>

<p>SlideCrunch will look for the text associated to each slide and
timing information taken from <a href="#inputfile"><tt>slideshow.txt</tt></a>.
The resulting document
will be <tt>slideshow.srt</tt>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To <strong>split a slideshow into individual bitmaps</strong> (i.e. image
files), type:</p>

<pre>
slidecrunch burst
</pre>

<p>SlideCrunch will split the slides taken from <tt>slideshow.pdf</tt>
into individual JPEG files called <tt>slideshow-1.jpg</tt>, <tt>slideshow-2.jpg</tt>,
and so on. Each image will have a resolution of 800x600 pixels.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To <strong>produce an <a href="https://github.com/AviSynth/AviSynthPlus">AviSynth++</a>
mixing script</strong> from a set of slides, type:</p>

<pre>
slidecrunch avisynth
</pre>

<p>SlideCrunch will look for a list of images numbered <tt>slideshow-1.png</tt>,
<tt>slideshow-2.png</tt>, and take the
timing information from <a href="#inputfile"><tt>slideshow.txt</tt></a> to produce a script for
AviSynth+. (No requirement, but you need AviSynth+ to execute the resulting
script, see the <a href="#requirements">requirements</a>.)</p>
</li>

</ol>

<!-- }}} -->

<a name="install"></a><h2>Installing and executing</h2> <!-- {{{ -->

<p>SlideCrunch consists of a single PHP script, called <tt>slidecrunch</tt>.
Just copy it in your working directory (or anywhere else).
You can invoke it in two ways.</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>php slidecrunch</tt>: this calls the PHP interpreter to run
the file</li>
<li>Under Linux: <tt>./slidecrunch</tt> if you set the file as executable
(with <tt>chmod u+x slidecrunch</tt>). You can also copy the file into,
e.g. <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt> so that you can run it from anywhere.</li>
</ul>

<!-- }}} -->

<a name="inputfile"></a><h2>What to put in <tt>slideshow.txt</tt></h2> <!-- {{{ -->

<p>The file <tt>slideshow.txt</tt> is a simple text file
required by SlideCrunch for almost
all its options. Think of it as some form of "movie script"
that describes what is in you slideshow; each option looks into that file
for different kinds of
information:</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>The <strong>list of input files</strong> (PDF or SVG) from which the
slides are taken. To tell SlideCrunch to include a file, start a new line
using the pipe (<tt>|</tt>) character followed by the file name, e.g.:</p>
  <pre>
  | myfirstfile.pdf
  | mysecondfile.svg
  | etc.
  </pre>
<p>SlideCrunch will take that list of files, produce the corresponding PDF
(if the file is SVG), and then merge all these files together in the order
they appear to produce the resulting slideshow. The same filename can appear
multiple times (it will be repeated as many times as it appears), and the
list needs not be grouped: filenames can be interspersed with other
lines of information. SlideCrunch reads the whole file to find all the
inputs.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Text associated to each slide</strong>. You can use the slideshow
file to put text for each slide, such as comments on the slide or a direct
transcript of your talk. To tell SlideCrunch you give information on a
slide, you start a new line with a slide marker, most commonly the star
(<tt>*</tt>) character, followed by any lines of text you like:</p>

<pre>
* This is some text associated to a slide.
The text spans multiple lines.

* This is the text for the following slide.
Again we have multiple lines and it's OK.
</pre>

<p>Everything that follows the marker is considered as text for the slide,
until a new marker is found, which starts another slide. Blank lines count,
too: hence in the previous example, the carriage return between the two
blocks of text counts as text for the first slide. (This is important if
you want to produce paragraphs in handouts.)</p>

<p>The symbols <tt>&lt;</tt> and <tt>&gt;</tt> are also slide markers. They
matter only if you want to produce a handout and you don't want all slides
to be displayed on paper; for all other options they behave exactly like
the star. See <a href="#handouts">How to create handouts</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Slide timing and numbering.</strong> Right next to the slide marker, you can
specify the slide number and the time this slide should be displayed, expressed
in number of minutes:seconds.xxx since the start of the presentation. </p>

<pre>
*1*00:00.000* This is the first slide at the beginning
of the presentation.

*2*00:10.500* This is the second slide, that appears 10.5 seconds
after the beginning.

*3*00:15.500* This is the third slide, that appears 15.5 seconds
after the beginning. Since the previous slide appeared at 10.5 s,
the second slide effectively lasts 5 seconds.
</pre>

<p>Beware,
the time is not the slide duration, but the elapsed time since the beginning!</p>

<p>If you use timing, you should also place one last slide marker to
indicate the end of the presentation (and the length of the last slide).
Hence if the complete presentation lasts 32 minutes and 52 seconds, you
write:</p>

<pre>
*END*32:52.000*
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Slideshow metadata.</strong> You can have the output PDF have
some of its fields filled with relevant information, such as author, title,
keywords, etc. Many applications use the information in the PDF for
display purposes, e.g. showing the PDF's title metadata in the window's
title bar, etc. To specify metadata, just write the field followed by its
value:</p>

<pre>
Author: Donald Duck
Title:  Title of my presentation
</pre>

<p>This information can also be used in the handout: the title and author
are displayed at the top of the first page. You can specify any fields you
want, but they have to be at the top of the file. Once SlideCrunch sees a slide
marker, it stops looking for metadata. (This is to avoid the confusion between
a line of text that starts with a word and a colon.)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Comments.</strong> Any line that starts with two slashes
(<tt>//</tt>) is ignored. You can use it to put annotations and comments
into your file, for more readability</p>

<pre>
// This is my first presentation with SlideCrunch
// Made by me on 11-11-11

// We start with the list of files
| 1.pdf
| 2.pdf
// | 3.pdf &lt;- this file won't be added

// Then the slides
* Hello, this is slide one.
...
</ol>

<p>No single part of the file is mandatory: each option looks for different
pieces of information. Namely:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>slideshow</tt> only looks for input files and metadata, if any</li>
<li><tt>handout</tt> only looks for slide text</li>
<li><tt>subtitles</tt> looks for slide text and timing information</li>
<li><tt>avisynth</tt> only looks for timing information</li>
</ul>

<!-- }}} -->

<a name="handouts"></a><h2>Walkthrough #1: How to create handouts</h2> <!-- {{{ -->

<p>A handout displays mini-slides and their associated text side-by-side,
and is useful as presentation notes that you can print and distribute.
SlideCrunch can be used to automatically generate a PDF handout from your
slides and text. You need:</p>

<ul>
<li>A PDF of your slides, with each page being a slide. We assume the file
is called <tt>slideshow.pdf</tt>.</li>
<li>The list of slides and their associated text, marked in the <a href="#inputfile">format
described above</a>. The file is called <tt>slideshow.txt</tt>.</li>
</ul>

<p>To simplify things, the commands to SlideCrunch assume the file names
given above. Try to have the same filenames as in the tutorial --you can rename the files to your liking once
you're done. Otherwise,
make sure you replace the names appearing here with your own filenames;
use the <a href="#options">command line options</a>.</p>

<h3>Create the handout: default version</h3>

<p>If you don't want to change anything, simply type:</p>

<pre>
slidecrunch handout
</pre>

<p>SlideCrunch will look for the slides in <tt>slideshow.pdf</tt>, place
them vertically at around 4 per page (this depends on the amount of text),
with the text associated to each slide
taken from <a href="#inputfile"><tt>slideshow.txt</tt></a>. 
The resulting document will be
<tt>handout.pdf</tt>.</p>

<h3>Overlays and "animation"</h3>

<p>Some of your slides may consist of elements that are progressively
shown or hidden, such as a bullet list where items are added one by one.
In the resulting PDF file, this means that the same "slide" is repeated
multiple times, each with one more element added to the previous one.
In a handout, these "animation" effects create a lot of repeated slides;
it is more appropriate to simply keep the "complete" slide and not include
the partial animations.</p>

<p>You can tell SlideCrunch that a slide should not be displayed by replacing
the normal slide marker (<tt>*</tt>) with either <tt>&lt;</tt> or
<tt>&gt;</tt>. The choice of which marker to use depends on what you want
to do with the text associated to that slide: <tt>&lt;</tt> asks SlideCrunch
to merge it with the text of the <em>last</em> displayed slide, while <tt>&gt;</tt>
merges the text with that of the <em>next</em> displayed slide. Consider
the following example:</p>

<pre>
* This is slide 1.
&gt; This is slide 2.
&gt; This is slide 3.
* This is slide 4.
* This is slide 5.
&lt; This is slide 6.
</pre>

<p>The handout for this presentation will have three slides, those numbered
1, 4 and 5, with the following text for each:</p>

<table border="1">
<tr><td>(Slide 1)</td><td>This is slide 1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>(Slide 4)</td><td>This is slide 2. This is slide 3. This is slide 4.</td></tr>
<tr><td>(Slide 5)</td><td>This is slide 5. This is slide 6.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Changing the template</h3>

<p>SlideCrunch provides a default template for creating handouts. You can
override these defaults and provide your own template, written as a LaTeX
file structured as follows:</p>

<pre>
\documentclass &lt;- whatever declarations
\usepackage... &lt;- whatever packages
\begin{document}
...
%%SLIDE_CONTENT_HERE
...
%%BEGIN_SLIDE_TEMPLATE
...
(Template for each slide)
...
%%END_SLIDE_TEMPLATE
...
\end{document}
</pre>

<p>When producing the handout, SlideCrunch will take what's inside the
<tt>%%BEGIN</tt>&hellip;<tt>%%END</tt>
block as the code template for each slide. (This block is
a declaration, it won't be part of the resulting document in itself.)
It will then insert the generated content for all slides at the location
of the <tt>%%SLIDE_CONTENT_HERE</tt> marker. All the rest of the document
can be whatever LaTeX code you like.</p>

<p>SlideCrunch will replace special words in you LaTeX file with information
from the presentation and current slide. All text is properly
  escaped to form a valid LaTeX input.</p>

<h4>Global words (work anywhere)</h4>

<ul>
<li><tt>%%AUTHOR</tt>: the author of the presentation, if specified in
<tt>slideshow.txt</tt></li>
<li><tt>%%TITLE</tt>: the title of the presentation, if specified in
<tt>slideshow.txt</tt></li>
<li><tt>%%SLIDE_WIDTH</tt>: the width given to slide thumbnails; the
default (<tt>3in</tt>) can be overridden through the command-line
switch <tt>--width</tt></li>
</ul>

<h4>Slide words (works in slide template only)</h4>

<ul>
<li><tt>%%SLIDE_TEXT</tt>: put it at the location in the file where you
  want the text of the current slide to be shown.</li>
<li><tt>%%PAGE_NO</tt>: the page number in the source PDF for the current slide</li>
<li><tt>%%FILE_NAME</tt>: the filename of the source PDF</li>
</ul>

<p>To replace the default template, either:</p>

<ol>
<li>Put in your working directory a file called <tt>handout-template.tex</tt>;
SlideCrunch looks for such a file every time it is run; or</li>
<li>Use the command-line argument <tt>-t</tt> to specify a filename for the
template to use</li>
</ol>

<h3>Cue markers</h3>

<p>You can also add cue markers throughout the text to indicate the moments
where slides change. This is useful in particular when text from multiple
slides is merged into a single entry, to know where along the text one is
expected to move forward in the "animation". The command-line option
<tt>--show-cues</tt> enables this behaviour.</p>

<p>When activated, SlideCrunch
will add in the text at the proper location a call to a user-defined command
<tt>\cu<b><u>r</u></b>marker{p}</tt>, where <i>p</i> is the current page number in the
source PDF. If the slide change corresponds to a slide that is not being displayed
in the handout, then SlideCrunch inserts <tt>\cu<b><u>e</u></b>marker{p}</tt>
instead (notice the difference: cu<b><u>e</u></b> vs. cu<b><u>r</u></b>).
It is up to you to define what such a marker should
look like by defining your own LaTeX commands. (SlideCrunch's default
template provides an example.)</p>

<!-- }}} -->

<a name="slidecasts"></a><h2>Walkthrough #2: How to create a slidecast</h2> <!-- {{{ --->

<p>You need to have all these files, copied in the same folder for convenience:</p>

<ul>
<li>A slideshow PDF, where each page is one slide. You can create such slideshows
with SlideCrunch itself, or use any other PDF.
</li>

<li>The recording of your slidecast in an audio file (such as MP3, WAV or
OGG). Mine was called <tt>slideshow.mp3</tt>. I won't tell you how to record
yourself properly, I guess there are tutorials for that.</li>

<li>The complete text of your slidecast in a plain-text file. Mine was
called <tt>slideshow.txt</tt>.</li>
</ul>

<p>To simplify things, the commands to SlideCrunch assume the file names
given above. Try to have the same filenames as in the tutorial --you can rename the files to your liking once
you're done. Otherwise,
make sure you replace the names appearing here with your own filenames;
use the <a href="#options">command line options</a>.</p>

<h3>What <em>software</em> you need</h3>

<p>If you don't have the following, please install them using the default options before
moving on. All of these are free.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.virtualdub.org/">VirtualDub</a>, a video file editor
(or <a href="http://www.avidemux.org/admWiki/doku.php">AviDemux</a> for Linux users, both work essentially the same way)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.avisynth.org/">AviSynth</a>, a non-linear video processing engine</li>
<li>An audio player, such as <a href="http://www.winamp.com/">Winamp</a>, <a href="http://www.foobar2000.org/">foobar2000</a>,
Windows Media Player. This will be used to figure out the time points where you change your slides. If you
want to be more precise and don't mind the (slightly) extra complexity, you can use a full-fledged audio
editor such as <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a>.</li>
<li>The MidVid JPEG Video Codec (Google, download and install)</li>
<li>SlideCrunch, obviously.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 0: split the PDF into separate images</h3>

<p>This is a pre-step: simply run</p>

<pre>
slidecrunch burst
</pre>

<p>and SlideCrunch will produce a
set of image files (in JPEG format, but this can also be changed), numbered
sequentially from 1 to whatever number of slides you have. In my example,
the files are called <tt>slideshow-001.png</tt> to
<tt>slideshow-125.png</tt>.</p>

<h3>Step 1: setup the time points</h3>

<p>The first part of the work is the most tedious one: you must write down the moments in the audio file where you move
to the next slide. These will be expressed in the number of minutes and seconds elapsed from the beginning of your speech.</p>

<p>To do so, open <tt>slideshow.mp3</tt> in your audio player, and start playing the file with your slideshow at hand. When the audio reaches the moment where you need to go to the next slide, press Pause on the audio player and write down the elapsed time. Most audio players have a cursor that you can move around to jump back or forward, so if you missed the cue, you can rewind a few seconds and try again.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.leduotang.com/sylvain/sites/default/files/Winamp.jpg" alt="Screenshot" /></p>

<p>You will then insert these "cuepoints" throughout the text file <tt>slideshow.txt</tt> containing the transcript of your audio, as follows. Suppose this is the text for the beginning of my presentation:</p>

<pre>
Hello, my name is Sylvain, and this is my super duper
presentation. You will see how the sildes change
automatically when I jump to the next topic.

You see? Now we are at the second slide, and if we
had a third one, we could jump to it as well.
...
</pre>

<p>Your first cuepoint is (obviously) slide number 1 at the beginning of the first
paragraph. This corresponds to the beginning of the audio file, so 0 minutes and 0
seconds. You write this as <tt>*#*mm:ss.xxx*</tt>, where:</p>

<ul>
<li># is the slide number</li>
<li>mm:ss.xxx is the elapsed time, with mm minutes, ss seconds and xxx milliseconds</li>
</ul>

<p>If your media player doesn't show milliseconds, you can just replace them with "000". So
the first cuepoint is written <tt>*1*00:00.000*</tt>, and you place it at the beginning
of your file, in front of the first paragraph:</p>

<pre>
<strong>*1*00:00.000*</strong> Hello, my name is Sylvain, and this is my super duper
presentation. You will see how the sildes change
automatically when I jump to the next topic.

You see? Now we are at the second slide, and if we
had a third one, we could jump to it as well.
...

</pre>

<p>Suppose now you measured that the second slide should be shown at
7.5 seconds from the beginning, you insert the second cuepoint at its
appropriate location in the text:</p>

<pre>
*1*00:00.000* Hello, my name is Sylvain, and this is my super duper
presentation. You will see how the sildes change
automatically when I jump to the next topic.

<strong>*2*00:07.500*</strong> You see? Now we are at the second slide, and if we
had a third one, we could jump to it as well.
...
</pre>

<p>...and so on. A slide change can occur in the middle of a sentence:</p>

<pre>
...
If we continue talking, you will realize that


<strong>*3*00:14.000*</strong> I switched to the next slide while
I talked.
</pre>

<p>Just make sure that a cuepoint begins at the start of the new line.
Similarly, a paragraph that doesn't start with a cue point is just
that: a paragraph, and is considered as the continuation of the text
for the current slide.</p>

<p>Finally, finish your text with the end time for your audio file.
Mine was 32 minutes and 52 seconds long, so I put this as the last
line of my text file:</p>

<pre>
<strong>*END*32:52.000*</strong>
</pre>

<h3>Step 2: Generate the slideshow</h3>

<p>The first step was rather tedious, but once your text is annotated with the
slidechanges and time points, a lot of fun things can be done
automatically.</p>

<p>If you used the filenames in this tutorial, the default values
are setup properly. Just run:

<pre>
slidecrunch avisynth
</pre>

<p>The script will create a file <tt>slideshow.avs</tt>
with a bunch of commands like
these:</p>

<pre>
# --------------------------------------------------
# Auto-generated file by slidecrunch
# (C) 2010-2020 Sylvain Hallé
# --------------------------------------------------

video = ImageSource("Slide_001.jpg", end=98, fps=4).BicubicResize(640,480)
video = video + ImageSource("Slide_002.jpg", end=79, fps=4).BicubicResize(640,480)
video = video + ImageSource("Slide_003.jpg", end=60, fps=4).BicubicResize(640,480)
...
</pre>

<h3>Step 3: Save the slide show as a video</h3>

<p>You have two ways of doing this: using VirtualDub (has a GUI), or ffmpeg (scriptable).</p>

<h4>Option 1: using VirtualDub</h4>

<p>Now open VirtualDub, an in the File menu, click Open and select
<tt>Slidecast.avs</tt>. (You may not see the file in the list;
if this is the case, make sure that the "Files of type" drop-down list
at the bottom is set to "AVIFile input driver".)</p>

<p>Your file should open as a video, showing the first slide:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.leduotang.com/sylvain/sites/default/files/VD-1.jpg" alt="Screenshot" /></p>

<p>VirtualDub provides controls to play the file. However an AviSynth
script file like the one you just loaded is a bit different; <em>don't</em>
press the Play button or move around the file
unless you know what you're doing. (If you're
curious, more on that later.)</p>

<p>To export your presentation as a video, you must setup compression
settings for audio and video:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the Audio menu, choose Direct Stream Copy</li>
<li>In the Video menu, choose Full Processing Mode if it is not already checked</li>

<li>Go back to the Video menu, and choose Compression...</li>
<li>At the left is a list of compression formats, or <em>codecs</em>.
You can pick any one, but for this tutorial select "MidiVid JPEG Codec".
(If you think using DivX or other stuff, see below.)
<p><img src="http://www.leduotang.com/sylvain/sites/default/files/VD-2.jpg" alt="Screenshot" /></p>
</li>
<li>Leave the Quality slider to a relatively high value (say, at least 80).
Click OK.</li>
<li>In the File menu, choose Save as AVI. Save it as <tt>Slidecast.avi</tt>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Depending on your computer's speed and the length of your slidecast, the process can take from
a few seconds to several minutes. Be patient.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.leduotang.com/sylvain/sites/default/files/VD-3.jpg" alt="Screenshot" /></p>

<p>Once this is done, you can double-click on <tt>Slidecast.avi</tt> or open it
into any media player, such as Windows Media Player. It should show the slides that
change along with the audio, at the timepoints you gave in your text file. Voilà!</p>

<h4>Option 2: using ffmpeg</h4>

<pre>
ffmpeg -i slideshow.avs -c:v libx264 -crf 28 slideshow.mp4
</pre>

<h3>Bonus: generate the subtitles</h3>

<p>Since you have the complete transcript of your slidecast AND
a bunch of cuepoints telling how that text is distributed over time,
for free you can also generate a subtitle file that can be used to
display text over your video, like in movies.</p>

<p>Of course, you realize that you probably say a lot of text over
a single slide --certainly much more that what can fit in one or two lines
of text at the bottom of the screen. The trick is this: since we
know how long each slide lasts, we will split its associated
text into 1 or 2-line
snippets and spread them evenly over the total duration of the slide.
I tried it with my own slidecast, and I was surprised how closely
the text follows the audio --almost as if someone used a
teleprompter!</p>

<p>Doing so is really simple with SlideCrunch: just run</p>

<pre>
slidecrunch subtitles
</pre>

<p>This time, the script produces another text file called
<tt>slideshow.srt</tt> that looks like
this:</p>

<pre>
0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,750
Hello, my name is Sylvain, and this is
my super duper
presentation. You will see how the

1
00:00:03,750 --&gt; 00:00:07,500
sildes change
automatically when I jump to the next
topic.

2
00:00:07,500 --&gt; 00:00:10,750
You see? Now we are at the second
slide, and if we
had a third one, we

3
00:00:10,750 --&gt; 00:00:14,000
could jump to it as well.
If we continue
talking, you will realize that

</pre>

<p>This is a file in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip">SubRip</a> (SRT) format.
Each bunch of text is one subtitle; notice how the text for the first slide
in our example (lasting 7.5 seconds) has been split into two cards lasting 3.75
seconds each.</p>

<p>If you re-open <tt>slideshow.avi</tt> in your media player, this time
the subtitles, taken from the file,
should also be shown as you talk (this happens every time
an <tt>xxx.srt</tt> file exists in the same folder as <tt>xxx.avi</tt>.
In my case, the result
was spookily faithful.</p>

<p>Some online services, such as YouTube, allow you to <a href="http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=100079">attach subtitles</a>
to an online video.</p>

<a name="requirements"></a><h2>Requirements</h2> <!-- {{{ -->

<p>SlideCrunch is mostly the "glue" between a bunch of existing applications
to help producing slideshows.
Hence to run SlideCrunch, you need some other software installed, depending
on your use. All of them are <strong>free</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>A PHP interpreter. SlideCrunch is written in PHP. PHP is free and there
are distributions for all OSes, see <a href="http://php.net">php.net</a> for
a starting point. (Required all the time.)</li>

<li><a href="http://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/">pdftk</a>,
the PDF toolkit. This is necessary to join/split PDF files (i.e. the 
<tt>burst</tt> and
<tt>slideshow</tt> options).</li>

<li><a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>, if you want to
create handouts. (You can also
tell SlideCrunch to produce the LaTeX file without
calling LaTeX to compile it, see the <a href="#options">options</a>.)</li>

<li><a href="http://projects.abourget.net/inkscapeslide/">InkscapeSlide</a>,
if you want to automatically split multi-layer SVG files
into multi-page PDFs (in the <tt>slideshow</tt> option).</li>

<li><a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a>,
if you want to convert PDFs automatically into image files (e.g. in the
<tt>burst</tt> option).</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/AviSynth/AviSynthPlus">AviSynth+</a>, a powerful
frameserver, to produce the video file from a set of slides. Actually,
SlideCrunch does not require AviSynth, but you need AviSynth to process the fil
that SlideCrunch produces. <strong>The downloadable release on AVS+ website is
outdated.</strong> Download the latest release straight from GitHub.</li>

</ul>

<a name="about"></a><h2>About the author</h2> <!-- {{{ -->

<p>SlideCrunch was written by <a href="http://leduotang.ca/sylvain">Sylvain Hallé</a>,
full professor at <a href="http://www.uqac.ca/">Université du Québec à Chicoutimi</a>,
who prepares lots of presentations, slidecasts and handouts, and who was
tired of doing what SlideCrunch is now taking care of automatically. Think
of how much spare time now lies ahead.</p>

<a name="issues"></a><h2>Known issues</h2> <!-- {{{ -->

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/sylvainhalle/slidecrunch/issues">GitHub page</a>
reports all bugs and known issues. If you find a bug,
please add it there. However there are a couple of known issues we know
about.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you include SVGs and create a slideshow, you must be in a
directory whose full path from the root of the file system does not
contain any space. This is due to a bug in inkscapeslide, which
SlideCrunch uses in the background.</li>
<li>Actually, that's the only issue we know about for the moment.</li>
</ul>
